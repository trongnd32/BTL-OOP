Forgive me, hero. I need you to intervene.
Last week they came in the night, killed some of our most skilled people and left. 
Hero, we need your help to bring justice to those stinking miscreants. 
I offer you my assistance, but it's up to you if you want me to join you or not.
You are fully capable to handle those miscreants. 
Killing all of them won't be necessary, someone like you will be able to do plenty of damage to them.
I cannot thank you enough for your help, I'll make sure to reward you greatly once you return. 
Be swift and strike true hero, we're counting on you.
Pardon me, hero. You've come at the right time.
In the middle of the night our camp was attacked by a boar. 
That's right, attacked! It came in, trashed the place and ran off, but not without taking half the camp with it. 
All our stuff is scattered throughout the forest and that beast is still out there. 
I don't want to spend another minute near that monster.
I will do my best to give you a suitable reward, but I can't promise it will be amazing.
Please excuse me, hero. I need a helping hand.
There's a magnificent old creature which roams our lands. 
It's an elephant, older than almost all of us, but unfortunately its age is taking its toll. 
The predators are no longer afraid to attack it, more and more scars show up on its skin each day. 
Normally we'd let nature run its course, but this elephant is special, it means a lot to us. 
I'm afraid there's not much I can reward you with, but I think I can still make it worth your troubles.
Pardon me, hero. You've come at the right time.
I'm afraid some of our scouts have been captured.
We never leave one of our own behind, so we must free them, but sending in a small army will be the death of them for sure. 
Those monsters will kill our scouts once they see us, they take no risks. 
So we need you to go on your own, infiltrate their camp and save our troops. 
Curse those nasty fiends. I'll join you, if you'll have me. It'll be my pleasure.
Tread carefully hero, only a fool would underestimate the fiends. 
You can kill as many of them as you wish, destroy all of them if you want, curse those lowlives.
Unfortunately there's not much I have to reward you with, but I think there's a few bits and pieces left. 
Best of luck hero, make sure you return in one piece.
You there, hero. I'm in need of your service.
Why won't they just leave us alone? We've got nothing left to give, yet they keep coming back for more. 
Hero, please, I beg of you, get rid of those horrible trolls. 
If you don't mind, I'd like to come along. It's your choice though.
They'll be no match for you, those trolls. 
Try to take down as many of them as possible, the less of a threat they pose the better.
I wish I could pay you far more than I can, but what I can pay isn't less than what's fair either. 
Best of luck hero, make sure you return in one piece.
There was once a noble order of druids who lived in the nearby forest.
They still live there, but they are no longer noble, far from it.
Their rituals seem more demonic than anything else and we cannot let them go on. 
It's your choice though.
Be careful hero, don't underestimate those creatures.
Try to take down as many of them as possible, the less of a threat they pose the better.
I'm afraid there's not much left I can reward you with, but I think I can still make it worth your troubles. 
For justice and honor!
Excuse me, champion. You've got to help me.
A disease is plaguing the critters of our forest, it's horrible. 
Fortunately I think I can find a cure, but I will need some of those critters to study them and try out the cure.
Bring me back about 6 critters, it doesn't matter what kind. 
Just be careful of other creatures which might get stuck in the traps as well, they might not be as friendly.
If you decide to help me I will repay you handsomely, it'll be worth your troubles.
